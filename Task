We have a bar with 15 tables in which the main customers were the local alcoholics, 
they were making a lot of problems to the owner of the bar, going home without paying
on the next day comming back and agruing about how much money they owed and how much alcohol they consumed.
So the bar owner decided that he had to make a software in which he can enter: number of table, 
names of clients who sat on the table, what they ordered. Write a program with an appropriate menu and the following functionality:
- fillNewClient
- fillNewConsumption
- calculateTableConsumption

NOTES*
- The clients and consumtion for each table must be linked lists
- The program needs to be realized in minimum 3 files 
Example - main.c, structureHeader.h, structureFunctionality.h
